# LimSim

LimSim is a Long-term Interactive Multi-scenario traffic Simulator, which aims to provide a continuous simulation capability under the complex urban road network.

**The code is about to be released.** Checkout the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNeNtm096CAyYD1JJnkQ4gMaoFSdFLn2y) first for our awesome videos!

## üéÅ Main Features

- [x] **Long-term**: Traffic flow can be generated over long periods under the guidance of demand and route planning.

- [x] **Diversity**: The built-in behavioral models take heterogeneous driving styles of vehicles into account.

- [x] **Interactivity**: Vehicles in the scenario area are controlled  address sophisticated interactions among vehicles.

- [x] **Multi-scenario**: The universal road components supports a variety of road structures in the real world.

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI

LimSim has a cross-platform user-friendly GUI, which includes not only a beautiful simulation interface, but also information on road network and ego-vehicle status.

## üìä Scenario Evaluation

After running a long-term simulation with all kinds of scenarios contained in it, LimSim generates a log report and extract the key scenarios via the evaluation results.
